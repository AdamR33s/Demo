**Project Examples**:

**DB Manager** - The Database Manager for the SCARS Bot
Overview - The file "old_db_manager.py" is the first version of this created over the first 9 - 12 months of the project. The second file " new_db_manager.py" is the re-write I recently completed after getting a thorough understanding of Sync vs ASync. This also uses a config parser to hide sensitive strings.

**Tarkov_api** - A large Graph QL Query project for serving data and services to users over discord. This is a work in progress and complicated by bad data all over the sets. The ll_tarkov_api.py file has the queries and DSL objects etc. The tarkov_caches file shows the amount of structured text data being handled which is actually around 2mb with the current inline fragments.
