These C# files are part of a Video Game I'm building in Godot fixed around the simulation of flying in space with realistic propelants etc.
A demonstration of 

- State Machines
- Classes
- Nested Classes 
- Enums 
- Access Protectors
- Lambda Functions
- Safe Data Modification Methods 
- some reasonably complicated Vector Math's to control object movement

The SpaceUI file is an example of updating Data via a display as quickly as once per visual frame using both Lambda's and Godot's built in "Signal".
